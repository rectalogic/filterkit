FilterKit
=========

This repo is a simple demo of using FilterKit (and ShaderKit) from [WebVfx](https://github.com/rectalogic/webvfx/tree/master/webvfx/resources/webvfx/scripts) to allow interactive scripted image processing in a web page.

See the live [FilterKit Demo](http://rectalogic.github.io/filterkit).

Some of the demo canned effects are ported to WebGL shaders from [filtrr](https://github.com/alexmic/filtrr)
